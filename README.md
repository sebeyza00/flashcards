# WEB102: React Knowledge Flashcards

I created a website to test out student's React Knowledge using Flashcards.

- Created a Flashcard component with a box and button. The box is clickable and changes from question to answer. The button changes the question.
- Two useState() variables are used. Count is used to switch from question to answer and questionNum is used to switch to another question.
- questionNum takes the value of a random number from 0 to the length of questionsList. Updated everytime the button is clicked.
- count takes a value of either 0 or 1. If box is clicked, this value is switched with a ternary operation.
